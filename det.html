        <p>1.Calculator can't calculate several operations at the same time : for example 5 + 5 / 5 = X its not possible.</p>
        <p>2.But chain of operations is fine: for example 2 ^ 4 = 16 √ = 4 + - 6 = - 2.</p>
        <p>3.Square root works on this way: 81 √ = 9.</p>
        <p>4.Exponentation works on this way:  -2 ^ 3 = -8.</p>
        <p>5. <em> 'If the result has more than 10 digits, it must be rounded down to show only the first 10 digits in total at all times'</em> </p>
              <p>Based on this condition result always includes less than 10 digit.</p>
